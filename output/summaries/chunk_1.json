  "title" : "BIOLOGY 101: The Fundamentals of Cell Biology",
  "summary" : "This lecture introduces the cell as the fundamental \"unit of life\" for all organisms, detailing its essential characteristics: metabolism, growth, response to environment, homeostasis, and genetic material. It distinctly categorizes cells into two main types: simpler prokaryotic cells (lacking a true nucleus, like bacteria) and more complex eukaryotic cells (possessing a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, like animal and plant cells). Key cellular components discussed include the protective cell membrane, the cytoplasm, and, in eukaryotes, the nucleus and mitochondria, which generate energy.",
  "key_points" : [ "The cell is the basic unit of organization and life, performing all necessary functions for living organisms.", "Cells exhibit key characteristics: metabolism, growth/reproduction, response to environment, homeostasis, and containing genetic material (DNA).", "Life is fundamentally divided into two cell types: prokaryotic (simpler, no true nucleus) and eukaryotic (complex, true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles).", "Basic cellular structures include the cell membrane (for protection and selective permeability), cytoplasm, and in eukaryotes, the nucleus (genetic control) and mitochondria (energy production)." ],
