  "summary" : "This chunk explores sophisticated prompting strategies including chain-of-thought, least-to-most, and concept-based prompting. These techniques improve model performance on complex tasks by breaking problems into manageable steps, mimicking human problem-solving approaches, and leveraging learned patterns from training data.",
