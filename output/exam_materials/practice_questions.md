3.  Describe the primary functions of the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum and the Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum.

        *   **Rough ER (RER):** Involved in the synthesis, folding, modification, and transport of proteins destined for secretion or insertion into membranes (due to ribosomes). (2 marks)
        *   **Smooth ER (SER):** Involved in lipid synthesis (e.g., steroids), detoxification of drugs and poisons, and storage of calcium ions. (2 marks)

4.  Explain the concept of homeostasis in the context of cell biology.
    *   **Expected Answer Points:** (2 marks)
        *   Homeostasis is the ability of cells to maintain a stable internal environment (1 mark) despite changes in the external environment. (1 mark) This is crucial for proper cell function and survival.

5.  Briefly outline the main events of Anaphase during mitosis.
    *   **Expected Answer Points:** (3 marks)
        *   Sister chromatids separate from each other at the centromere. (1 mark)
        *   They are pulled apart towards opposite poles of the cell (1 mark) by the shortening of spindle fibers/microtubules. (1 mark) Each chromatid is now considered an individual chromosome.

6.  How does cytokinesis differ between animal and plant cells?
    *   **Expected Answer Points:** (4 marks)
        *   **Animal cells:** A cleavage furrow forms (1 mark), which pinches the cell membrane inward until the cell divides into two distinct daughter cells. (1 mark)
        *   **Plant cells:** A cell plate forms in the middle of the cell (1 mark), growing outward to divide the cytoplasm and eventually forms new cell walls. (1 mark)

### Long-Form Questions

1.  Imagine you are observing a cell undergoing division under a microscope. Describe the entire cell cycle, including all interphase stages and the four phases of mitosis, detailing the key events that occur in each stage. Explain the ultimate purpose of this process for the organism.

    **Marking Rubric:**
    *   **Interphase Description (4 marks):**
        *   Correctly identifies G1 phase and describes it: cell grows, synthesizes proteins and organelles, carries out normal metabolic functions. (1 mark)
        *   Correctly identifies S phase and describes it: DNA replication occurs, each chromosome duplicates into two sister chromatids. (1 mark)
        *   Correctly identifies G2 phase and describes it: cell continues to grow, synthesizes proteins necessary for mitosis, prepares for division. (1 mark)
        *   States that G1, S, and G2 together constitute Interphase. (1 mark)
    *   **Mitosis Stages (Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase) Description (8 marks):**
        *   **Prophase:** Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, nuclear envelope breaks down, mitotic spindle begins to form. (2 marks)
        *   **Metaphase:** Chromosomes align along the metaphase plate (equatorial plane), spindle fibers attach to kinetochores of sister chromatids. (2 marks)
        *   **Anaphase:** Sister chromatids separate and are pulled apart to opposite poles of the cell, becoming individual chromosomes. (2 marks)
        *   **Telophase:** Chromosomes arrive at opposite poles and decondense, new nuclear envelopes form around the two sets of chromosomes, mitotic spindle disassembles. (2 marks)
    *   **Overall Purpose (2 marks):** Clearly explains the purpose of the cell cycle and mitosis (e.g., growth of multicellular organisms, repair/renewal of tissues, asexual reproduction in some eukaryotes, ensures genetic continuity for daughter cells). (2 marks)

    *   **Total: 15 marks**

2.  Discuss the interconnected roles of the Endoplasmic Reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and Lysosomes in the synthesis, modification, and breakdown of cellular components. Provide an example of how these organelles might cooperate to process a newly synthesized protein.

    **Marking Rubric:**
    *   **Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum (3 marks):**
        *   Describes **Rough ER (RER)** function: studded with ribosomes, involved in synthesis, folding, modification, and transport of proteins destined for secretion or membranes. (1.5 marks)
        *   Describes **Smooth ER (SER)** function: lacks ribosomes, involved in lipid synthesis, detoxification of drugs/poisons, and storage of calcium ions. (1.5 marks)
    *   **Role of Golgi Apparatus (3 marks):**
        *   Explains its function: receives proteins/lipids from ER via vesicles, modifies them (e.g., glycosylation), packages them, and sorts them into new vesicles for transport to their final destinations (cellular or extracellular). (3 marks)
    *   **Role of Lysosomes (3 marks):**
        *   Describes their function: membrane-bound sacs containing digestive enzymes, act as the cell's waste disposal and recycling center, breaking down cellular waste, macromolecules, old organelles, and foreign invaders. (3 marks)
    *   **Interconnection/Cooperation (3 marks):**
        *   Clearly explains how these organelles work together as a coordinated system (the endomembrane system) for the synthesis, processing, transport, and degradation of various cellular components. (3 marks)
    *   **Concrete Example of Protein Processing (3 marks):**
        *   Provides an accurate example: e.g., a secreted protein (like an enzyme) or a lysosomal enzyme itself.
        *   **Example flow:** Protein synthesis in **RER** (ribosomes) -> budding off in vesicles -> fusion with **Golgi apparatus** (cis-face) for further modification (medial region) and sorting (trans-face) -> packaging into new vesicles for transport to either the cell membrane for secretion OR to become a **lysosome** (if it's a lysosomal enzyme).
