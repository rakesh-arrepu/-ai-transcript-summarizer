### Must-Know Concepts & Key Definitions

*   **Cell:** The fundamental "unit of life," a membrane-bound compartment containing genetic material (DNA) and cytoplasm, capable of independent function.
    *   **Essential Characteristics:** Metabolism, Growth/Reproduction, Response to Environment, Homeostasis, Genetic Material (DNA).
*   **Homeostasis:** The ability of a cell (or organism) to maintain a stable internal environment despite external changes.
*   **Prokaryotic Cells:** Simple, primitive cells lacking a true membrane-bound nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Genetic material is in the **nucleoid**. (e.g., Bacteria, Archaea)
*   **Eukaryotic Cells:** Complex cells characterized by a true membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Generally larger and more complex. (e.g., Animal, Plant, Fungi, Protists)
*   **Nucleus (Eukaryotic):** The cell's control center, housing DNA (organized into chromosomes) and directing cell growth and reproduction.
*   **Mitochondria (Eukaryotic):** Often called the "powerhouses" of the cell, responsible for generating most of the cell's ATP (chemical energy).
*   **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):** An extensive network of membranes involved in synthesis and transport.
    *   **Rough ER (RER):** Studded with ribosomes; synthesizes, folds, modifies, and transports proteins destined for secretion or membranes.
    *   **Smooth ER (SER):** Lacks ribosomes; involved in lipid synthesis, detoxification of drugs/poisons, and calcium ion storage.
*   **Golgi Apparatus:** A stack of flattened sacs that modifies, packages, and sorts proteins and lipids received from the ER for final destinations.
*   **Lysosomes:** Membrane-bound sacs containing potent digestive enzymes; function as the cell's waste disposal and recycling centers, breaking down cellular waste, macromolecules, and foreign invaders.

### Important Processes: The Cell Cycle & Mitosis

*   **Cell Cycle:** The ordered series of events a cell undergoes to grow and divide, ensuring accurate DNA replication and distribution.
    *   **Interphase:** The non-dividing phase where the cell grows and prepares for division.
        *   **G1 Phase:** Cell grows, synthesizes proteins and organelles, normal metabolic functions.
        *   **S Phase (Synthesis):** DNA replication occurs; each chromosome is duplicated into two sister chromatids.
        *   **G2 Phase:** Cell continues to grow, synthesizes proteins for mitosis, prepares for division.
*   **Mitosis (M Phase):** The division of the nucleus, resulting in two genetically identical daughter nuclei. Crucial for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction.
    *   **Prophase:** Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes; nuclear envelope breaks down; mitotic spindle begins to form.
    *   **Metaphase:** Chromosomes align along the **metaphase plate** (equatorial plane).
    *   **Anaphase:** Sister chromatids **separate** and are pulled to opposite poles by spindle fibers.
    *   **Telophase:** Chromosomes decondense; new nuclear envelopes form around the two sets of chromosomes; spindle disassembles.
*   **Cytokinesis:** The division of the cytoplasm, typically following mitosis, separating the two new nuclei into distinct daughter cells.
    *   **Animal Cells:** Forms a **cleavage furrow** that pinches the cell in two.
    *   **Plant Cells:** Forms a **cell plate** in the middle, growing outward to divide the cytoplasm and form new cell walls.

### High-Yield Exam Tips

1.  **Visualize:** Use diagrams to understand organelle structures, their locations, and the stages of mitosis. Drawing them out can aid memory.
2.  **Function First:** For each organelle, prioritize understanding its primary function. Then, connect its structure to that function.
3.  **Process Flow:** Memorize the sequence of events for the cell cycle (G1->S->G2->M) and protein processing (ER->Golgi->Destination). Don't just list, understand the "why."
4.  **Compare & Contrast:** Be ready to differentiate key pairs: Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic, Rough ER vs. Smooth ER, Animal vs. Plant Cytokinesis. Use Venn diagrams or tables to solidify differences.
5.  **Keywords:** Actively define and use terms like "homeostasis," "selectively permeable," "ATP," "sister chromatids," "metaphase plate," and "centromere" in your explanations.
