## 1. Master Notes

### 1.1. Fundamentals of Cell Biology

**The Cell: The Basic Unit of Life**
The cell is the fundamental "unit of life" for all organisms. It is defined as the smallest unit of life that can function independently and perform all the necessary functions of life. It is a membrane-bound compartment containing genetic material (DNA) and cytoplasm.

**Essential Characteristics of Cells:**
All living cells exhibit several key characteristics:
*   **Metabolism:** The sum of all chemical processes that occur in an organism, including the breakdown of substances for energy and the synthesis of new substances.
*   **Growth/Reproduction:** Cells grow in size and divide to produce new cells.
*   **Response to Environment:** Cells can sense and react to stimuli from their surroundings.
*   **Homeostasis:** The ability of cells to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in the external environment.
*   **Genetic Material (DNA):** All cells contain DNA, which carries the instructions for cell function and heredity.

**Two Main Cell Types:**

1.  **Prokaryotic Cells:**
    *   **Definition:** Simple, primitive cells lacking a membrane-bound nucleus.
    *   Genetic material (DNA) is located in a region called the nucleoid, not enclosed by a membrane.
    *   Generally smaller and less complex than eukaryotic cells.
    *   Do not possess membrane-bound organelles.
    *   **Examples:** Bacteria, Archaea.

2.  **Eukaryotic Cells:**
    *   **Definition:** More complex cells characterized by the presence of a true membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
    *   Genetic material (DNA) is housed within the nucleus.
    *   Generally larger and more complex than prokaryotic cells.
    *   Possess specialized compartments (organelles) that perform distinct functions.
    *   **Examples:** Animal cells, Plant cells, Fungi, Protists.

**Basic Cellular Structures (Common to most cells, or specific to Eukaryotes):**
*   **Cell Membrane:** A protective, selectively permeable barrier that encloses the cell, regulating the passage of substances in and out.
*   **Cytoplasm:** The jelly-like substance that fills the cell, containing organelles and various molecules.
*   **Nucleus (Eukaryotes only):** The control center of the eukaryotic cell, containing the cell's genetic material (DNA) organized into chromosomes. It directs cell growth and reproduction. *(Cross-reference: Directs protein synthesis, which involves the ER and Golgi apparatus).*
*   **Mitochondria (Eukaryotes only):** Often called the "powerhouses" of the cell, these organelles are responsible for generating most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy.

### 1.2. Eukaryotic Organelles and Cell Division

**Specialized Eukaryotic Organelles:**

*   **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):**
    *   **Definition:** An extensive network of membranes extending throughout the cytoplasm, involved in the synthesis and transport of proteins and lipids.
    *   **Rough ER (RER):** Studded with ribosomes, primarily involved in the synthesis, folding, modification, and transport of proteins destined for secretion or insertion into membranes.
    *   **Smooth ER (SER):** Lacks ribosomes, involved in lipid synthesis (e.g., steroids), detoxification of drugs and poisons, and storage of calcium ions.

*   **Golgi Apparatus:**
    *   **Definition:** A stack of flattened membrane-bound sacs (cisternae) that modifies, packages, and ships proteins and lipids to their final destinations.
    *   **Workflow for Protein/Lipid Processing:**
        1.  Proteins/lipids are synthesized in the ER.
        2.  They bud off the ER in vesicles and fuse with the *cis*-face of the Golgi.
        3.  As they move through the Golgi cisternae (medial region), they are modified (e.g., glycosylation).
        4.  At the *trans*-face of the Golgi, they are sorted and packaged into new vesicles.
        5.  These vesicles transport the finished products to their final cellular or extracellular destinations.

*   **Lysosomes:**
    *   **Definition:** Membrane-bound sacs containing potent digestive enzymes.
    *   **Function:** Act as the cell's waste disposal and recycling center, breaking down cellular waste products, macromolecules, old organelles, and foreign invaders (like bacteria and viruses).

**Cell Division: The Cell Cycle and Mitosis**

*   **Cell Cycle:**
    *   The ordered series of events that a cell undergoes to grow and divide. It ensures that DNA is replicated accurately and distributed equally to daughter cells.
    *   **Stages:**
        1.  **G1 Phase (First Gap):** Cell grows, synthesizes proteins and organelles, and carries out normal metabolic functions.
        2.  **S Phase (Synthesis):** DNA replication occurs; each chromosome is duplicated, resulting in two sister chromatids.
        3.  **G2 Phase (Second Gap):** Cell continues to grow, synthesizes proteins necessary for mitosis, and prepares for division.
        *   *(G1, S, and G2 phases together constitute Interphase, the non-dividing phase).*

*   **Mitosis:**
    *   **Definition:** The division of the nucleus, resulting in two identical daughter nuclei. It is crucial for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction in eukaryotic organisms.
    *   **Four Stages of Mitosis (PMAT):**
        1.  **Prophase:**
            *   Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes (each consisting of two sister chromatids joined at the centromere).
            *   The nuclear envelope breaks down.
            *   The mitotic spindle begins to form from centrosomes.
        2.  **Metaphase:**
            *   Chromosomes align along the metaphase plate (equatorial plane) of the cell.
            *   Spindle fibers (microtubules) attach to the kinetochores of each sister chromatid.
        3.  **Anaphase:**
            *   Sister chromatids separate and are pulled apart by the shortening of spindle fibers towards opposite poles of the cell.
            *   Each chromatid is now considered an individual chromosome.
        4.  **Telophase:**
            *   Chromosomes arrive at opposite poles and begin to decondense (unravel).
            *   New nuclear envelopes form around the two sets of chromosomes.
            *   The mitotic spindle disassembles.

*   **Cytokinesis:**
    *   **Definition:** The division of the cytoplasm, which typically follows mitosis, separating the two new nuclei into distinct daughter cells.
    *   **Animal Cells:** A cleavage furrow forms, pinching the cell into two.
    *   **Plant Cells:** A cell plate forms in the middle of the cell, growing outward to divide the cytoplasm and form new cell walls.

### Short Answer Questions

1.  List three essential characteristics that define a living cell.
    *   **Answer:** Metabolism, growth/reproduction, response to environment, homeostasis, containing genetic material (DNA). (Any three are acceptable)

2.  Differentiate between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, providing one example for each type.
    *   **Answer:** Prokaryotic cells are simpler, lacking a true membrane-bound nucleus and membrane-bound organelles (e.g., bacteria). Eukaryotic cells are more complex, possessing a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles (e.g., animal cells, plant cells).

3.  Describe the primary functions of the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum and the Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum.
    *   **Answer:** Rough ER (RER) is involved in the synthesis, folding, modification, and transport of proteins destined for secretion or membranes, due to its associated ribosomes. Smooth ER (SER) is involved in lipid synthesis, detoxification of drugs/poisons, and calcium storage.

4.  Explain the concept of homeostasis in the context of cell biology.
    *   **Answer:** Homeostasis is the ability of a cell (or organism) to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in the external environment. This includes regulating temperature, pH, solute concentrations, etc., which is crucial for cell function and survival.

5.  Briefly outline the main events of Anaphase during mitosis.
    *   **Answer:** During anaphase, the sister chromatids separate from each other at the centromere. They are then pulled apart by the shortening of the spindle fibers (microtubules) towards opposite poles of the cell, effectively becoming individual chromosomes.

6.  How does cytokinesis differ between animal and plant cells?
    *   **Answer:** In animal cells, cytokinesis involves the formation of a cleavage furrow, which pinches the cell membrane inward until the cell divides into two. In plant cells, a cell plate forms in the middle of the cell, growing outwards to fuse with the existing cell wall and divide the cytoplasm, leading to the formation of new cell walls.
